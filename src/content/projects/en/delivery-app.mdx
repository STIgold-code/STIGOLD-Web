## The Challenge

The startup needed a mobile solution to connect delivery drivers with customers and track deliveries in real time.

## The Solution

We built a cross-platform mobile application with three interfaces: customer, driver, and administrator.

### Key Features

- Real-time delivery tracking with maps
- Push notifications for status updates
- Ratings and reviews system
- Admin dashboard with analytics

## Results

- **2,000+** deliveries managed in the first month
- **4.8/5** average rating on app stores
- **35%** reduction in delivery times
